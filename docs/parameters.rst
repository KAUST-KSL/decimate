======================

Then submission of parametric jobs requires to gather in a *parameter*
file all the combinations of parameters that one wants to run a job
against. This list of combination can be described as an explicit
array of values of programatically via a Python or shell script or
using simple directives.

We here detail these three ways of defining parameters. Execution of
parametric workflows is described at parametric_.
